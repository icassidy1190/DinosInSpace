DinosInSpace
============
You thought dinosaurs were extinct? Wrong! They’re in SPACE! 

Space is infested with dinosaurs now and as one of them, you must stand your ground! You must 

navigate the vast emptiness of deep space with the jetpack on your back and an endless supply of 

dinosaur eggs. But watch out, another dinosaur is trying to kill you! 

“Dinosaurs in Space!” is a two player arena battle experience. Shoot eggs at the other dinosaur, use 

your jetpack to move around, and zoom faster with a special boost to gain a tactical advantage against 

your opponent. Controls are as simple as sharing the keyboard with a friend. Just use the arrow keys 

or ‘w’, ’a’,’s’, ‘d’ to navigate!
